## Meet Our Team

In the beginning, a startup was founded by a group of robotic enthusiasts keen
on the gaming industry. At first, it was more of a casual venture until the
creation of their groundbreaking game, 'Kalamatic.' Five years later,
'Kalamatic' was sold to pave the way for a new chapter in their journey.

We are flying acorns, free to choose any path, skilled at growing into
towering trees. — Farshad Abdollahi
