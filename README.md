## Meet Our Team

In the beginning, a startup was founded by a group of robotic enthusiasts keen on the gaming industry. At first, it was more of a casual venture until the creation of their groundbreaking game, 'Kalamatic.' Five years later, 'Kalamatic' was sold to pave the way for a new chapter in their journey.

We are flying acorns, free to choose any path, skilled at growing into towering trees. â€” Farshad Abdollahi
